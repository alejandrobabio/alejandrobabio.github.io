You must see this video, I transcribed the summary here in order to remember it. But, it make perfect sense after seen the conference.

Summary:

* If you're talking to nil, it's **something**. Use the Null Object Pattern. **Don't** check for nil.

* Ware Inheritance, it's not for **sharing** behaviour. There's no such thing as **one** specialization. You must Isolate the thing that varies. Name the concept. Define the role. And them Inject the players.

* Belive in Nothing. I don't want to write a condition, I want to send a message to an Object. It seems like nothing, but **Nothing it's always Something**.
